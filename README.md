# Understanding DevOps  

DevOps is an **approach to software development and IT operations** that emphasizes **collaboration, automation, and efficiency** to streamline the software delivery lifecycle. It brings together **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)** teams to enable **continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), rapid releases, and improved system reliability**.  

### Core Principles of DevOps:  
1. **Team Collaboration** ‚Äì Encouraging seamless interaction between development and operations teams.  
2. **Process Automation** ‚Äì Implementing automation for testing, deployment, and infrastructure management.  
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** ‚Äì Ensuring frequent code integration and smooth automated deployments.  
4. **Monitoring & Feedback** ‚Äì Continuously tracking system performance and incorporating user feedback.  
5. **Security Integration (DevSecOps)** ‚Äì Embedding security measures throughout the development pipeline.

---

### Why DevOps?  

Traditional software development models, such as the **Waterfall approach**, often struggle with **delayed deployments, communication gaps, and inefficient workflows**. DevOps overcomes these challenges by:  

1. **Accelerating Delivery** ‚Äì Automated pipelines streamline software releases.  
2. **Enhancing Quality** ‚Äì Continuous testing minimizes defects before production.  
3. **Ensuring Scalability & Reliability** ‚Äì Cloud-native DevOps practices optimize performance.  
4. **Fostering Collaboration** ‚Äì Developers and IT teams work in sync for seamless operations.  
5. **Reducing Costs** ‚Äì Automation cuts down manual work, downtime, and operational expenses.  

In modern **cloud computing, microservices, and AI-driven systems**, DevOps plays a vital role in maintaining agility and efficiency.  

**DevOps = Speed + Quality + Stability!**

## **Project Overview**
This project follows a well-structured approach to **development, deployment, and automation**:

#### **Development & Testing**
- The core logic is in `main.py`, and `test.py` ensures correctness.

#### **Automation & Deployment**
- **Jenkins** automates CI/CD pipelines via `Jenkinsfile`.
- **Ansible** manages deployment with `deploy.yml` and `inventory`.

#### **Containerization**
- The `Dockerfile` ensures a portable and reproducible environment.

#### **User Interface**
- The **web-based frontend** is in `static/index.html`.

This structured approach ensures **scalability, efficiency, and automation** in software development.

## Code snippets

This Python code defines a simple **FastAPI-based scientific calculator** that provides various mathematical operations as API endpoints. The `@app.get` decorators define routes for different calculations:

- **`/`** ‚Üí Serves the `index.html` file for the frontend.
- **`/sqrt/{x}`** ‚Üí Returns the square root of `x`.
- **`/factorial/{x}`** ‚Üí Returns the factorial of `x`.
- **`/ln/{x}`** ‚Üí Returns the natural logarithm of `x`.
- **`/power/{x}/{b}`** ‚Üí Computes `x` raised to the power of `b`.

Each function extracts parameters from the URL, performs the operation using Python‚Äôs `math` module, and returns the result as JSON.

---


This Python code contains unit tests for a FastAPI-based scientific calculator using a test client. Each function sends a GET request to an API endpoint and verifies the response:

- **`test_square_root()`**: Checks if `/sqrt/9` returns `3.0`.
- **`test_factorial()`**: Ensures `/factorial/5` returns `120`.
- **`test_natural_log()`**: Tests if `/ln/1` returns `0.0`.
- **`test_power()`**: Verifies `/power/2/3` returns `8.0`.

Each test asserts that:
1. The API response has a **status code of `200`**.
2. The computed result matches the expected value.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation for local machine

#### 1 Clone Repository   
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ParvGatecha/SPE-Mini
```


#### 2 Running the FastAPI Server  
Start the application using Uvicorn:  
```sh
python main.py
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### 3 Running Tests  
To verify the API functionality, run the test suite using **pytest**:  
```sh
pytest test.py
```

---
## Docker build and run

```
docker build -t parvg/scientific-calculator .
```
This will use the Dockerfile in our directory to create a docker image

It can then be run with 
```
‚ùØ docker run -d --name sci-cal -p 8000:8000 parvg/scientific-calculator
```
Expose the port 8000 of the container to port 8000 of the local machine. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

---
## Docker Image to DockerHub

Once the Image is built, we can push it to DockerHub to make it publically accessible.
#### 1 Docker Login
Login into docker.
```
docker login
```

#### 2 Tag the Image
```
docker tag parvg/scientific-calculator parvg/scientific-calculator:latest
```

#### 3 Push Image to DockerHub
```
docker push parvg/scientific-calculator:latest
```

## Deploy Using Ansible

#### Prerequisites
- Ansible installed on your local machine
- Docker installed on the target machine
- SSH access to the target machine
- Required Ansible collections installed (`community.docker`)

### Steps to Deploy the Container

#### 1. Set Up Ansible Environment
Ensure Ansible is using the correct Python interpreter:
```yaml
vars:
  ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python
```

#### 2. Ensure Docker is Installed
Check if Docker is installed, and install it if necessary:
```yaml
- name: Install Docker
      apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present
```

#### 3. Start Docker (if Not Running)
Ensure Docker is running before proceeding:
```yaml
- name: Start Docker (if not running)
  shell: open -a Docker
  ignore_errors: yes

- name: Wait for Docker to be available
  command: docker info
  register: docker_status
  until: docker_status.rc == 0
  retries: 10
  delay: 5
```

#### 4. Pull the Latest Docker Image
Download the latest version of the scientific calculator Docker image:
```yaml
- name: Pull the latest Docker image
  community.docker.docker_image:
    name: "parvg/scientific-calculator"
    source: pull
```

#### 5. Remove Existing Container (if Running)
Ensure no previous instance of the container is running:
```yaml
- name: Remove existing container (if running)
  community.docker.docker_container:
    name: sci-cal
    state: absent
```

#### 6. Deploy the Scientific Calculator Container
Start a new container with the latest image:
```yaml
- name: Run the container
  community.docker.docker_container:
    name: calculator-container
    image: "parvg/scientific-calculator:latest"
    state: started
    restart_policy: always
    ports:
      - "8000:8000" # Corrected port mapping for FastAPI
```

                sh 'docker build -t parvg/scientific-calculator .'
            }
        }
```

### 5. Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
Tags and pushes the Docker image to the repository.
```groovy
stage('Push to Docker Hub') {

                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'docker-hub-credentials', usernameVariable: 'DOCKERHUB_USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD')]) {
                    sh 'echo $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD | docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin'
                    sh 'docker push parvg/scientific-calculator'
                }
            }
        }
```

### 7. Clean Up Docker Images
Removes old Docker images to free space.
```groovy
stage('Clean Up Docker Images') {
    steps {
        sh "docker rmi ${DOCKER_TAG} || true"  // Remove old images
        sh "docker rmi ${DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME} || true"
    }
}
```

### 8. Deploy Using Ansible
